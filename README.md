# Comply-22

Comply-22 is a graph-based compliance engine. 

It uses Neo4J to map relationships between different information security regulations, legislation and best practices. A REST API can be used to query the mapping information.

Comply-22 can also be used to document the application, implementation and assessment of security controls over time.

## Engine / REST API

The first version is currently being developed.
